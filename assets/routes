# This is a routing template.
# Use syntax below to define server routes:
# /some/path : /other/path # Routes all request that start with /some/path to /other/path
# /other = /some # "=" means same as ":"
# /another > /other # Redirects all requests that start with /another to /other
# Add "&" in the beginning and "/" at the end of the line to enable RegExp matching.
# &/c([au])t/ : /m$1d # Routes all requests from /cat and /cut to /mad and /mud respectively
# You can also add second "&" to make match case sensitive.
# && /Rat/ : /mouse # Will not match /rat
